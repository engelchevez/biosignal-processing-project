# biosignal-processing-project
A MATLAB and Graphical analysis of a given signal, analysis done using Fourier Transformation and band-pass filtering to remove low hertz interference. 
This is my Github project, an extra-credit optional assignment I did in my intro to BME computing.

## Overview of Project

This assignment and project does the following: 
-Loads and with graphs visualizes the ('Mystery_Signal.mat') file
-Uses FFT BUILT-IN MATLAB function to find "important frequencies"
-Frequency-domain filter, for specific frequency bands in the signal 
-manual DFT using MATLAB 'for loops' 
-Comapre manual DFT with FFT MATLAB function
